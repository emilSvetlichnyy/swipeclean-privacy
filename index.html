    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="date">Last updated: ___</div>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how the application "<strong>App Name</strong>"
        (the “App”) handles user information.
    </p>

    <p>
        By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. General Information</h2>
    <p>
        We respect your privacy and strive to minimize the collection and processing of data.
        The App is designed so that its core functionality operates <strong>locally on the user's device</strong>,
        without transmitting personal data to external servers, except as explicitly described in this Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Access</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Access to Photos and Videos</h3>
    <p>
        The App may request permission to access your photos and videos solely to provide
        features such as viewing, sorting, and deleting media files at the user’s request.
    </p>
    <p>
        The App does <strong>not upload</strong>, <strong>store</strong>, or <strong>transmit</strong>
        your photos or videos to external servers.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Personal Data</h3>
    <p>The App does not collect or store:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Names</li>
        <li>Email addresses</li>
        <li>Phone numbers</li>
        <li>Precise location data</li>
        <li>Contacts</li>
        <li>Photo or video content</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Technical Information</h3>
    <p>
        The App may use limited technical information provided by the operating system
        (such as iOS version) solely to ensure stable operation of the App.
    </p>
    <p>
        This information does not identify the user, is not used for tracking,
        and is not shared with third parties for marketing purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p>
        The App may offer paid subscriptions. All payments are processed exclusively
        through the Apple App Store using Apple’s payment infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not collect, store, or have access to payment card details or billing information.
        Payment processing is governed by Apple’s own privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        All user settings and data related to the App’s functionality
        (such as sorting preferences or interface options)
        are stored locally on the user’s device.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may delete this data at any time by removing the App from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or transfer user data to third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data may be disclosed only if required by law or in response to valid legal requests.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p>
        The App does not use advertising trackers and does not track users across apps or websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the approach to analytics changes in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable organizational and technical measures to protect user data.
        However, no method of data storage or transmission is completely secure,
        and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>8. User Rights (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>
        If you are located in the European Union, you have the right to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Request information about data processing</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your data</li>
        <li>Restrict data processing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Since the App does not store personal data on external servers,
        most requests can be fulfilled by deleting the App from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
        The updated version becomes effective upon publication within the App or on this page.
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend reviewing this Policy periodically.
    </p>
